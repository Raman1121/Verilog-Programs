#GRAY CODE
For gray code, copy the MSB and take XOR of the (1st,2nd), (2nd,3rd) and (3rd,4th) bits

module gray_code(input[3:0] x, output[3:0] y);

reg[3:0] x;
wire[3:0] y;

y[3] = x[3];         //copy the MSB 
y[2] = x[3] ^ x[2];  //XOR
y[1] = x[2] ^ x[1];  //XOR
y[0] = x[1] ^ x[0];  //XOR

endmodule
